    PixelStick Code in C
  </h1>

  <h2>
    This code is the culmination of a group effort from me, John Jacob, and Ronak Desai in our efforts to create our own version of the PixelStick. The PixelStick reads in images     of either BMP or JPEG format and prints them onto the specified number of LEDs on the strip. EEProm features are included to save work, and switch statements are used to           navigate the system in place for the display (including brightness, saved images, etc.). Below are some images we captured using our lightstick:
