# RSA Encryption implementation
This project was completed for my CSCI 104 class (Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming). It implements the RSA Standard Encryption algorithm using an input file. Compile using a standard Linux compiler like g++ with the executable name 'rsa' followed by an input string and two prime numbers (for guaranteed encryption).
